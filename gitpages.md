# Github Pages

## Simple
In basic form serves up html (index.html) or markup (index.md)

no server side scripting (you can use html, css, javascript)

- github uses  a site generator called Jekyll, that uses html and/or md
- main config file is _config.yaml
- can set a theme in the settings (Jekyll Theme Chooser)
- new commits causes the generator to run over the git contents
- markdown requires 'Front matter' in the start of md

 title: My Title
 layout: post
 ---'
